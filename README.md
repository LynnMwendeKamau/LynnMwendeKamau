### Stopping by? 
### Hi, I'm Lynn Mwende Kamau, a recent Software Engineering graduate based in Nairobi, Kenya📍.

👩🏾‍💻 One time in high school, I wrote a script using HTML and used the marquee element, crowned myself a coding wizard🧨. So, I ventured into it in uni only to meet Java and get this, I had to learn physics and statistics too💀 (tough times don't last, I lasted🌵).

🎓 I specialize in Front-End Engineering, bringing a keen eye for design and user experience to every project. Eager to expand my horizons, I am currently delving into the intricacies of Back-End Engineering to create holistic solutions.

💡 Courses in Human-Computer Interaction have equipped me with a nuanced understanding of user needs, enabling me to craft intuitive and user-friendly applications. I find joy in the meticulous process of coding and the challenge of debugging, viewing each line as an opportunity for improvement.

🚀 When I'm not immersed in code, find me exploring my culinary skills, pedaling through scenic routes on my bike, or embarking on new adventures through travel. Life, like coding, is a journey of continuous exploration.

📚 Open to collaboration and driven by a commitment to quality, I invite you to connect and explore opportunities for synergistic endeavors. Thank you for considering the prospect of collaboration. Looking forward to the possibility of working together!

I just wanted to look cool coding behind my backlit laptop wearing a hood in a dark room!✨🔮
